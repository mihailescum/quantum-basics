# About

This is a project to learn the basics of quantum computing. We will follow "Quantum computing from a mathematical perspective: a description of the quantum circuit model" by J. Ossorio-Castillo and José M. Tornero ([https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.08277](arXiv:1810.08277v2)) an implement severl quantum algorithms in qiskit.
