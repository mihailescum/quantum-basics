# About

This is a project to learn the basics of quantum computing. We will follow "Quantum computing from a mathematical perspective: a description of the quantum circuit model" by J. Ossorio-Castillo and José M. Tornero ([arXiv:1810.08277v2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.08277)) an implement severl quantum algorithms in qiskit.

## Installation

1. Install `conda` and create an environment with `python` and `pip` installed.
2. Install the following dependencies
    - `qiskit` and `qiskit-aer`
    - `jupyter`
    - `matplotlib` and `pylatexenc`
3. Install the package by running `pip install -e .` from the project root.
